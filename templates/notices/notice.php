 * HOWEVER, on occasion Online Restaurant Reservation will need to update template files and you
 * and you (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
