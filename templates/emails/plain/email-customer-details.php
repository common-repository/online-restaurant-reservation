/**
 * Additional Customer Details (plain)
 *
 * This is extra customer data which can be filtered by plugins.
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/restaurant-reservation/emails/plain/email-customer-details.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion Online Restaurant Reservation will need to update template files and you
 * and you (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
